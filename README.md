This project was developed by the author Pankaj Bhowmik to fulfil one of his academic course titled "System Analysis and Design" aka "SAD". I tried to make a community within Hajee Mohammad Danesh Science and Technology University, Dinajpur, Bangladesh where people can help one others in need of blood. This web based project is especially developed using Bangla language user interface.
